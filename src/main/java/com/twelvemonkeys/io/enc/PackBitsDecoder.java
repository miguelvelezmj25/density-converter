/**
 * Decoder implementation for Apple PackBits run-length encoding.
 * <p/>
 * <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small><br/>
 * PackBits is a fast, simple compression scheme for run-length encoding of
 * data.
 * <p/>
 * Apple introduced the PackBits format with the release of MacPaint on the
 * Macintosh computer. This compression scheme is one of the types of
 * compression that can be used in TIFF-files.
 * <p/>
 * A PackBits data stream consists of packets of one byte of header followed by
 * data. The header is a signed byte; the data can be signed, unsigned, or
 * packed (such as MacPaint pixels).
 * <p/>
 * <table><tr><th>Header byte</th><th>Data</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>0 to 127</td>    <td>1 + <i>n</i> literal bytes of data</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>0 to -127</td>   <td>One byte of data, repeated 1 - <i>n</i> times in
 *                           the decompressed output</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>-128</td>        <td>No operation</td></tr></table>
 * <p/>
 * Note that interpreting 0 as positive or negative makes no difference in the
 * output. Runs of two bytes adjacent to non-runs are typically written as
 * literal data.
 * <p/>
 * See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1023.html">Understanding PackBits</a>
