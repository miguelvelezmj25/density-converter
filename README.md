# Density Converter
Program to convert images to specific formats and sizes.

**Input:** Image file.

**Output:** Converted image file to specific format and size.

## Performance Bug Report

I am using your program to convert an image (found in `./pictures`), but the program is taking too long to execute (about 156 seconds).
This is the configuration that I used: 

* `scale = true`

### Scale option

Whether to scale the output image to a larger size.

## Task
Determine why the program is taking too long based on the configuration indicated in the bug report.  

## Assumptions

* The input image is valid.
* You have successfully reproduced the bug report and confirmed the performance behavior.
* The program runs in fixed hardware. 
That is, the developer replying to the bug report cannot suggest the user to run the program on faster hardware.
