# Density Converter
Program to convert images to specific formats and density versions.

**Input:** Image file.

**Output:** Converted image file to specific format and density.

## Bug report

I am using your program to convert an image (found in `./pictures`), but the program is taking too long to execute (about 49 seconds).
This is the configuration that I used: `scale = true`.
Could you please help me understand why is the program taking so long? Is there anything that I can do on my end to speed up the program?

## Scale option

Sets by how much to scale down images. 
When you pass `true` as a program argument, then `scale = true (1f)`.
When you pass `false` as a program argument, then `scale = false (3f)`.
